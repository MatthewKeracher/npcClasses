"description": "<div>Thieves are those who take what they want or need by stealth, disarming traps and picking locks to get to the gold they crave; or âborrowingâ money from pockets, beltpouches, etc.<br><br>right under the nose of the âmarkâ without the victim ever knowing.</div><div><br></div><div>Thieves fight better than Magic-Users but not as well as Fighters.<br><br>Avoidance of honest work leads Thieves to be less hardy than the other classes, though they do pull ahead of the Magic-Users at higher levels.</div><div><br></div><div>The Prime Requisite for Thieves is Dexterity; a character must have a Dexterity score of 9 or higher to become a Thief.<br><br>They may use any weapon, but may not wear metal armor as it interferes with stealthy activities, nor may they use shields of any sort.<br><br>Leather armor is acceptable, however.</div><div><br></div><div>Thieves have a number of special abilities, described below.<br><br>One Turn must generally be spent to use any of these abilities, though the GM may amend this as he or she sees fit.<br><br>The GM may choose to make any of these rolls on behalf of the player, at his or her option, to help maintain the proper state of uncertainty.<br><br>Also note that the GM may apply situational adjustments (plus or minus percentage points) as he or she sees fit; for instance, itâs obviously harder to climb a wall slick with slime than one that is dry, so the GM might apply a penalty of 20% for the slimy wall.</div><div><br></div><div><h3 style=\"font-family: SoutaneBlack;\">Open Locks</h3></div><div><br></div><div><div>Open Locks&nbsp;allows the Thief to unlock a lock without a proper key.<br><br>It may only be tried once per lock.<br><br>If the attempt fails, the Thief must wait until he or she has gained another level of experience before trying again.</div><div><br></div><div><h3 style=\"font-family: SoutaneBlack;\">Remove Traps</h3></div><div></div><br><div>Remove Traps&nbsp;is generally rolled twice: first to detect the trap, and second to disarm it.<br><br>The GM will make these rolls as the player wonât know for sure if the character is successful or not until someone actually tests the trapped (or suspected) area.</div><div><br></div><div><h3 style=\"font-family: SoutaneBlack;\">Pick Pockets</h3></div><div><br></div><div>Pick Pockets allows the Thief to lift the wallet, cut the purse, etc of a victim without the victim noticing.<br><br>Obviously, if the roll is failed, the Thief didnât get what he or she wanted; but further, the intended victim (or an onlooker, at the GMâs option) will notice the attempt if the die roll is more than two times the target number (or if the die roll is 00).</div><div><br></div><div><h3 style=\"font-family: SoutaneBlack;\">Move Silently</h3></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><br></span></div><div>Move Silently, like Remove Traps, is always rolled by the GM.<br><br>The Thief will usually believe he or she is moving silently regardless of the die roll, but those he or she is trying to avoid will hear the Thief if the roll is failed.</div><div><br></div><div><h3 style=\"font-family: SoutaneBlack;\">Climb Walls</h3></div><div><br></div><div>Climb Walls&nbsp;permits the Thief to climb sheer surfaces with few or no visible handholds.<br><br>This ability should normally be rolled by the player.<br><br>If the roll fails, the Thief falls from about halfway up the wall or other vertical surface.<br><br>The GM may require multiple rolls if the distance climbed is more than 100 feet.<br><br>See Falling Damage.</div><div><br></div><div><h3 style=\"font-family: SoutaneBlack;\">Hide</h3></div><div><br></div><div>Hide&nbsp;permits the Thief to hide in any shadowed area large enough to contain his or her body.<br><br>Like Move Silently, the Thief always believes he or she is being successful, so the GM makes the roll.<br><br>A Thief hiding in shadows must remain still for this ability to work.</div><div><br></div><div><h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Listen</span></h3></div><div><br></div><div>Listen&nbsp;is generally used to listen at a door, or to try to listen for distant sounds in a dungeon.<br><br>The GM must decide what noises the Thief might hear; a successful roll means only that a noise could have been heard.<br><br>The GM should always make this roll for the player.<br><br>Note that the Thief and his or her party must try to be quiet in order for the Thief to use this ability.</div><div><br></div><div><h3><br></h3></div></div><h2 style=\"font-family:'SoutaneBlack'\"><br></h2><h3 style=\"font-family:'SoutaneBlack'\"><br></h3>",

The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton; rather, it perceives his or her words and actions in the most favorable way. The caster can try to give the subject orders, but it will not do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do, and further may receive an additional saving throw to overcome the magic (at the GM's discretion). The caster must speak the target's language to communicate any commands, or else be good at pantomiming; of course, if the caster is attacked, the charmed creature will act to protect its \"friend\" (though that could mean attacking the caster's enemies, or attempting to carry off the caster to a \"safe\" place).

The conjurer, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at will (doing so on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the Mage loses concentration, control of the summoned Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only dispel magic or dispel evil will banish the elemental once control has been lost.

Any spell or effect having a caster level equal to or less than the dispel magic caster's level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a 20% chance of failure.

"description": "A fireball spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level to every creature within a spherical volume having a 20' radius. A save vs Spells for half damage is allowed. The explosion creates almost no pressure. The caster points a finger and determines the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, he or she must roll a missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit the opening, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely. The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze.

Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell. The reverse spell, stone to flesh, acts as a counterspell for flesh to stone, restoring the creature just as it was when it was petrified.

It can hold a maximum of 500 pounds of weight. (Note that water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon.) The disc must be loaded so that the items placed upon it are properly supported, or they will (of course) fall off. For example, the disc can support just over 62 gallons of water, but the water must be in a barrel or other reasonable container that can be placed upon the disc. Similarly, a pile of loose coins will tend to slip and slide about, and some will fall off with every step the caster takes; but a large sack full of coins, properly tied, will remain stable. The disc floats level to the ground, at about the height of the caster's waist. It remains still when within 10' of the caster, and follows at the caster's movement rate if he or she moves away from it. The floating disc can be pushed as needed to position it but will be dispelled if somehow moved more than 10' from the caster.

The subject can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, with the same maneuverability as the subject has when moving on the ground. Flying under the effect of this spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can neither charge nor run, nor carry aloft more weight than his or her maximum load. Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 120' per round for 1d10 rounds. If the subject reaches the ground in that amount of time, he or she lands safely. If not, the subject falls the rest of the distance, taking normal falling damage. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the fly spell is dispelled. "

"description": "Geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity. A saving throw vs Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a geas when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the geas, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his or her own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions, at the GM's discretion. For every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the geas (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 3 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas. A geas (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse spell, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel magic does not affect a geas. "

The caster may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when the caster's soul returns to his or her own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and the caster must know where it is, though he or she does not need to be able to see it. When the caster transfers his or her soul upon casting, the caster's body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body would. Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. The subject is allowed a save vs Spells to resist. Failure to take over the host leaves the caster's life force in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration of the spell. If the caster is successful, his or her life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. The caster keeps his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities (including spellcasting ability). The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow the caster to make more attacks than normal. The caster does not have access to any extraordinary or supernatural abilities of the body. If the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken (whether by dispel magic or physical damage): If the jar is in range of the caster's body, the caster's spirit returns to its body. Otherwise, the caster's spirit departs (the caster dies). In either case, the spell ends. If the caster's spirit is driven from the host body by dispel evil: If the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster's spirit returns to the jar, and the host's spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit is freed from the jar (and departs), and the host's body dies. If the host's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken: If the jar is in range of the host's body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the host's spirit departs, and the caster's spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. Dispel evil can still be used to drive the caster's spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell. In any case where the spell ends with the caster's body unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die. "

The voice will resemble the caster's, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use command words or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the caster's command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 60 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance. "

The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of \"evil\" is left to the individual GM to decide. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are \"evil\" or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

In the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one scroll (other than a spell scroll; for instance, a protection scroll or a treasure map); this mode is permanent. This spell does not work on magical texts, such as scrolls or spellbooks; see Read Magic, below, for the correct spell to use in such cases. The spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in any way hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts the caster doesn't otherwise have the ability to understand. Also, for this spell to function, there must be at least one living creature that can read the given language somewhere on the same plane. The knowledge is not copied from that creature's mind; rather, it is the existence of the knowledge that enables the spell to function. "

"description": "With this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or humanoid creature) in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work. Roll on the following table to determine what sort of creature the character becomes. Since the dead character is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the character's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the character's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated. A reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character's ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.) The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total from the character's original hit point total; this is the new form's hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. A character that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age. The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form.

The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a creature's save vs Spells prevents items in its possession from being teleported. The caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table below. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: \"Very familiar\" is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. \"Studied carefully\" is a place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one hour. \"Seen casually\" is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic. \"False destination\" is a place that does not truly exist or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80. On Target: The caster appears exactly where desired. Off Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead. Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster have gotten \"scrambled.\" Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time \"Mishap\" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll. "

If the caster so desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the ground. The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halved the area. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13 Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size or smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush larger creatures.

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won't cause the attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected area will. Anyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a save vs Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again. If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move or perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.

The caster must have some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described to the caster. Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function. The locale can be outdoors or underground. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. The location must be on the same plane as the caster at the time of casting. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to detect secret doors and to know any passwords required. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. "

Unfriendly animals may save vs Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused or panicky afterward (at the GM's discretion). All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size. The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals. "

The reversed spell, harm, injures the creature touched so horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The caster must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case; failure means the spell is wasted. Note that, if the victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number rolled, he or she will take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in which harm may kill a creature). Generally, both heal and harm only affect living creatures. If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm; likewise, harm affects undead like heal. Constructs such as golems are unaffected by either spell. "

The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function. Reversed, light becomes darkness, creating an area of darkness just as described above. This darkness blocks out Darkvision and negates mundane light sources.

Doing so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing ambient light level. Either version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target's ocular organs. The target is allowed a saving throw vs Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all.

"level": "1",
"description": "This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of \"evil\" is left to the individual GM to decide. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are \"evil\" or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions in all ways as described above, save that \"good\" creatures are kept away, rather than \"evil\" creatures. "

The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a quest cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity. A saving throw vs Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service. The affected creature must follow the given instructions until the quest is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions. If the subject is prevented from obeying the quest for 24 hours, it takes 3d6 points of damage each day.

In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is raised, permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can't be raised). This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion. Also note, a character who died with spells prepared has none prepared upon being raised. A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current hit dice. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell. A creature which has become undead can't be raised by this spell. Constructs and elementals cannot be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age. The reverse of this spell, slay living, will kill instantly the creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a human, demi-human or humanoid) unless a save vs Spells is made.

"description": "A basilisk is an eight-legged reptilian monster that petrifies living creatures with a mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly. Some specimens sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult basiliskâs body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its tail, which can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The creature weighs about 300 pounds.\n\n Any living creature which meets the gaze of the basilisk must save vs Petrification or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs Petrification or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its reflection.",

"description": "Dopplegangers are strange beings that are able to take on the shapes of those they encounter; they can also read minds (as the spell, ESP, but with no limit of duration). In its natural form, the creature looks more or less humanoid, but slender and frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed features. The flesh is pale and hairless. Its large, bulging eyes are yellow with slitted pupils. A doppleganger is hardy, with a natural agility not in keeping with its frail appearance. In its natural form a doppleganger is about 5Â½ feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.\n\nDopplegangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society. Although not usually evil, they are interested only in themselves and regard all others as playthings to be manipulated and deceived.\n\nWhen in its natural form, a doppleganger strikes with its powerful fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other armed person, it attacks with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such cases, it uses its mind reading power to employ the same tactics and strategies as the person it is impersonating.\n\n Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish âtrueâ dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven âage categories,â ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.\n\nIf one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.\n\nA dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).\n\nEach dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.\n\nThe breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.\n\nThere are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a ânormalâ shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three shapes.\n\nThe shapes are:\n\nCone Shaped: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).\n\nLine Shaped: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.\n\nCloud Shaped: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.\n\nAll dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of âtalking;â this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for âtalkingâ is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.\n\nSome dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.\n\nAlthough goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure. It's pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would have about double the given amount, while one of the next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).",

"description": "Plains dragons are the smallest of the true dragons. They have yellow skin dappled with light green patches, spots, or sometimes thin stripes. The color dulls and darkens with age until it reaches an almost uniform tan color at the oldest age category. They have long sinuous bodies and unusually long legs, giving them the fastest land movement rate of any dragon, but they are also accomplished fliers, as fast and maneuverable as any dragon. Plains dragons may hunt on the wing, attacking suddenly from above and surprising on 1-3 on 1d6; or, they may lie in wait in tall grass or a copse of trees, using their coloration as camouflage. As one ages and its colors dull, this ability improves; when lying in wait, they gain surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 at age categories 2 and 3, on 1-4 in age categories 4 through 6, and on 1-5 at age category 7. The breath weapon of the plains dragon is a scorching, shimmering cone of heat, barely visible to the naked eye; at night, however, a glow like steel being forged can be seen streaming from the dragon's open mouth."

"description": "Cloud dragons have the most varied appearance of all the true dragons. In an indoor environment or when underground, a cloud dragon appears to be a bright metallic color, while outdoors their coloration is brighter and less metallic, and may take on a reddish or bluish cast reminiscent of a sunrise or sunset. Hatchlings have a coppery skin tone, brightening to silver at the second age category, then to gold at the fourth before fading to a platinum tone by age category 6. While most true dragons become duller in color and sheen as they age, cloud dragons do not. Cloud dragons are not cruel and do not seek to kill for pleasure. Many tales are told of cloud dragons offering assistance to adventurers, though they are every bit as avaricious as any dragon; adventurers in need of gold need not bother asking for a loan. Another way in which cloud dragons differ from other types is that they do not have fixed breath weapons. Upon reaching the second age category, a cloud dragon acquires the breath weapon of a randomly-chosen (or GM assigned) dragon type; upon reaching the fourth age category, they acquire a second breath weapon type. Cloud dragons possess the same immunities as the dragons whose breath weapons they reproduce. All cloud dragons have the power to assume the form of any type of humanoid (as described in the spell charm person) at will in a manner otherwise equivalent to the spell polymorph self."

Those hit by a ghastâs bite or claw attack must save vs Paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns. Elves are immune to this paralysis. Ghasts try to attack with surprise whenever possible, striking from behind tombstones and bursting from shallow graves; when these methods are employed, they are able to surprise opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. They are undead, and thus are immune to sleep, charm and hold magics. They may be Turned by Clerics using the same column as the ghoul. As they are superior to ghouls, in a mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the GM should apply Turning effects to the ordinary ghouls first.\n\nHumanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghast fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 10% chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to save vs Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.\n\nAn afflicted humanoid who dies of ghast fever rises as a ghast at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghast in this way retains none of the knowledge or abilities he or she possessed in life. The newly-risen ghast is not under the control of any other ghasts, but hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other ghast in all respects.\n\nThe stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a save vs Poison or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack rolls). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ghastâs stench for 24 hours. A neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.\n\nGhost*\n\nGhosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. A ghost normally resembles the form it had in life, but sometimes the spiritual form is altered. For instance, the ghost of someone who believed he or she was evil might look a bit demonic. Because they are incorporeal, ghosts may be hit only by magical weapons.\n\nSeeing a ghost is so terrible that the victim must save vs Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds. A character or creature who successfully saves vs a given ghost's fear attack may not be so affected by that ghost again, but of course may still be affected by another.\n\nA ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 1d8 points of damage, and at the same time regenerates the same number of hit points. In addition, the victim loses 1 Constitution point. Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs Death Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit. Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have a Constitution score, the GM should assign whatever score he or she sees fit.\n\nLost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per casting of restoration; nothing else (except a wish) can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character's Constitution falls to 0, he or she dies permanently and cannot be raised (but still may be reincarnated).\n\nOnce per turn, a ghost can use telekinesis (as the spell) as if it were a 10th level Magic-User.\n\nInstead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a living creature. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (as if cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be able to move into the target (so it is possible to outrun it). The target can resist the attack with a successful save vs Spells. A creature that successfully saves is immune to being possessed by that ghost for 24 hours. If the save fails, the ghost enters the target's body and controls it; control may be maintained until the ghost chooses to leave the victim's body, or until it is driven out by means of a remove curse spell. While it is possessing a living creature, a ghost may not use any of its special abilities.",

"description": "Gnomes stand 3 to 3Â½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Males usually wear short, carefully trimmed beards.\n\nGnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years. They have Darkvision with a 30' range. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 20% chance they will be detected. If one or more gnomes who are successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6.\n\nGnomes speak their own language, Gnomish, and many know the language of the dwarves. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders or tinkers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. Gnomes encountered in the wilderness are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile. They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races. When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount of treasure.\n\n Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the statistics above are for such. In the lair, for every warrior there will be an average of three civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice and Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7. One out of every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a sergeant. Both warriors and sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor Class of 16 (11), adding a shield. In addition, in communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in plate mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus damage due to strength. In their community, gnomes never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on 1d6 that a community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2 on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6. Gnomish Clerics and Magic-Users are equivalent to regular gnomish warriors statistically.",

They are bad-tempered and territorial, but not particularly cunning.\n\nA hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion; however, most who fight them choose to strike at their heads. If a character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a particular head, and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be able to attack anymore. Such damage also applies to the monster's total hit points, of course.\n\nSome hydras live in the ocean; use the given movement as a swimming rate rather than walking in this case. A very few hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit a flame 10' wide and 20' long one time per head per day. This attack will be used about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it is available; roll for each head which is attacking. Each such attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs Dragon Breath reducing the amount by half.",

Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons, and a vampire will generally choose to use a melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than attempting to bite.\n\nVampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all undead are immune to sleep, charm and hold spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.\n\nVampires command the lesser creatures of the night and once per day can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such creatures are nearby). These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.\n\nA vampire can assume the form of a giant bator a dire wolf at will, requiring one round to complete the transformation. The flying movement listed is for the giant bat form. In animal form, the vampire can use the normal attacks for that form. It can't use its other powers while in animal form, except that creatures summoned are still controlled, and charms already in effect continue in effect.\n\nFor all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses:\n\nRepelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things donât harm the vampire â they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for the rest of the encounter.\n\nVampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship. They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all.\n\nSlaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampireâs hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesnât always destroy it, as described above. However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can act for only one round and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a vampireâs heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed, by water or sunlight as described above, or by burning it completely in a funeral pyre.",
